I totally forgot to post about this, but I ran 3 miles on the treadmill with an average pace of 10 minutes! It was
last Tuesday so September 23, 2014. I decided to just attempt running 3 miles again which I haven't done in awhile.
It was exciting to have hit the mark fairly easily. For the most part the first 2 miles were a breeze at 6 mph and
toward the 2.5 mile mark was when I started getting tired and a bit cramped at the knees. But I still trudged through
and upon hitting 3 miles, I celebrated inside!

Generally my workout routine consists of:

* 30 seconds of power walking at 3 mph.
* Complete to 1 mile at 7 mph.
* 30 seconds of power walking at 3 mph cooldown.
* Lift weights or do ab workouts.

I've been more consistent at doing this every Tuesday and Thursday and with some workout buddies at work. I'm really
happy of the progress that I've made. Generally I would do something simple. I hope starting October, that I will
pick up the pace a bit more with a possible run at the end of my workout, and heavier weights.

Anyways, on Tuesday, September 23, 2014, I went by myself since my coworker caught a cold and so I decided to just spend
the time running. And my mind was funny, it said "Run 3 miles!". So I did! I hadn't in a long time, but I knew I could
do it! I decided to just pace myself at 6 mph so that I'd hit 10 min per mile which is a huge improvement from my
previous runs that go 2+ miles long. In the past, I would run and walk, but this time I went consistently at 6 mph.
The treadmill helps a lot considering if this were outdoors, I wouldn't be able to be as consistent.

I clearly remember just not wanting to look at the distance and the first time I took a glance I had gone 1.2 miles.
Then 1.8 miles, then 2.5 miles. At that point, I couldn't help it, I was actually tired at my knees. I pushed myself
a bit too much but I think that it is for the better. Hitting the 3 mile mark was so rewarding that I felt that I had
made progress!

Overall, I can now run the mile in roughly 8 minutes and 30 seconds which is minutes ahead of my high school records!
Still not good enough, really want to be doing 7 minute miles as my main goal! Now that I know I can run 3 miles with
an average pace of 10 minutes per mile, I am extremely happy. I could remember in the past that doing such would
require running and then walking, running then walking, and even then I would not have completed it in 30 minutes.

Anyways, I just wanted to update on my progress and that I am motivated to reach my goals! I hope to do a 5k or even
10k run sometime! That'll be a 2015 goal! You heard it here :P
