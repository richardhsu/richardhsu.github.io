Well today was a failure. I missed a running day. It might be good since my
ankle wasn't feeling well over the weekend to the point that walking would be
painful. I think I've fully recovered though so I should definitely get back to
running.

It was funny though, I had dreams of running in the morning. At least part of me
was wanting to do it. Dreams are interesting, aren't they? I remember clearly
in my dream getting out of bed and then running around the neighborhood.
Unfortunately it was easy to tell it was a dream because I didn't eat a quick
breakfast nor did I brush my teeth which I always do in the morning. The crazy
part was this dream happened 3 different times with 3 different scenarios, all
very realistic.

Remember the following were dreams:

* The first run was great, felt normal and a cool brisk air in the neighborhood.
* The second run was interesting. It started raining but my motivation was off
the charts that I remember clearly thinking "Whatever, it's just rain." and
pushing forward. The only odd part was that there was a lot of school bus
traffic which I don't normally see.
* The third run was almost normal. It started off the same as the first run
with a cool brisk air and then suddenly there were snowflakes! I could hear
Christmas music and I was wearing warmer clothing which I actually don't own.
I enjoyed this one the most since I love Christmas time! But I definitely miss
the snow from when I lived on the East Coast.

Well, hopefully I can run later today or maybe tomorrow in the morning. I need
to keep healthy and lose weight! Cheers!
