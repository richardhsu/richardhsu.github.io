I'm starting to blog properly this time! I really want to start keeping track of
things and I thought that one way to get me excited to blog again would be to
actually create my blog using Jekyll. Get a little more gritty with the process
and learn a tool that has been around for "ages". I hope you enjoy this new
adventure and journey!

This is just a test post to start things off so don't mind the rest after this.

* Some bullet points to seem like there are important things to be done.
* But really they are just for emphasis.
* And I really think three bullet points are necessary.

Testing some `code insert` into the style and seeing how it'd look.

# More Code Tests

This is a test on the paragraph structure and adding some code:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
