While working on an iOS project, I encountered the realization that a massive storyboard was a bad idea.
It is simple and very easy to implement everything in one storyboard, but a large storyboard has many
drawbacks such as being slow to load, it is difficult to get a complete picture of what is going on, and
if you work with others it can be difficult to deal with version control. In this tutorial, I will
discuss how I separated out the main storyboard into multiple ones and how to get it to work specifically
with a `TabBarController`. At the end, I will discuss why I approached it the way I did and why I felt it
was a good way to do it, feel free to correct me or suggest other ways as I am still learning Swift and
iOS development!

## Introduction

My sample application will cover using the `TabBarController` in the storyboard mode and separating out
each tab into its own storyboard. This allows for:

* Modular sections.
* Faster to load storyboards.
* Smaller storyboards that are thus easier to understand.
* Easier to collaborate with version control.

### Disclaimer

I am still learning Swift and iOS development, I do not consider myself an expert and would actually
still consider myself a beginner, but I want to share what I've learned and worked out so far to help
others!

## Setting Up

To set up, create an iOS application as follows:

* Create a new **single page application** for iOS.
* Make sure to be using **Swift** as the language.
* You can leave **Core Data unchecked** as we do not need it.

### Remove Default View Controller

1. Remove the default `ViewController.swift` file and "Remove Reference" when asked.
2. In the `Main.storyboard` you can select the view controller that's present and delete it. We'll set up
a new `TabBarController` instead.

## Step 1: Add the Tab Bar Controller

1. Drag the Tab View Controller from the Utilities bar into the `Main.storyboard`.
2. Click on the Tab View Controller and in the Attributes inspector, check the "Is Initial View Controller".
XCode will thus know what to load when the application loads.

</a>
</center>


## Step 2: Add the View Controller in Storyboard

XCode is nice that the default Tab Bar Controller provides 2 tabs with `UIViewControllers`. However, just
to be sure, I will step through adding a new tab on the storyboard and setting up the separate storyboard:

1. The first step is to drag a View Controller from the Utilities bar into the `Main.storyboard`.
<center>
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/separate-storyboard/02-ctrldrag.png" />
</center>
2. Control drag from the Tab Bar Controller to the View Controller and under "Relationship Segue" select
"view controllers".
<center>
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/separate-storyboard/03-segue.png" />
</center>

This sets up the view controller so that it works with the `TabBarController`. You can then modify it as
you see fit for the tab icon and names.

### Step 3: Create the UIViewController

1. We're now going to start creating the separated section for the tab. We'll create a New Group in our
project called `First`. This will be to just be modular and keep all our files associated with the
"First" section such as the storyboard and the view controller to help set up using this separate
storyboard.
2. Then create a new file and choose `iOS > Source > Cocoa Touch Class` and we'll name it
`FirstTabViewController` and make sure it subclasses `UIViewController` and is a Swift file.
<center>
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/separate-storyboard/04-tabcontroller.png" />
</center>
3. This will now be the file we use to connect the two storyboards together! in `Main.storyboard` select
the first view controller for the first tab and in the Identity tab set the class to `FirstTabViewController`.
<center>
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/separate-storyboard/05-firstcontroller.png" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/separate-storyboard/05-firstcontroller-thumb.png" />
</a>
</center>

### Step 4: Create the New Storyboard 

1. Now we can set up the new storyboard for our "First" section or tab. Create a new file and choose
`iOS > User Interface > Storyboard` and save as `First` which will save as `First.storyboard`.
2. This will now be the storyboard that we add all our views for the "First" section or tab. In this
example, I will add a simple view controller and set the background to blue.
3. Make sure to set your entrance point to "Is Initial View Controller". **If you forget to do this, then
you will get an error on initializing the storyboard**.

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/separate-storyboard/06-firstinitial.png" target="_blank">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/separate-storyboard/06-firstinitial-thumb.png" />
</a>
</center>
4. Finally, to use the separate storyboard we will now add code to `viewDidLoad`
in `FirstTabViewController.swift`:

```swift
import UIKit

class FirstTabViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
        // Instantiate the separate storyboard for First section and load it
        var storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "First", bundle: nil)
        var controller = storyboard.instantiateInitialViewController() as! UIViewController
        addChildViewController(controller)
        view.addSubview(controller.view)
        controller.didMoveToParentViewController(self)
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
        // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
    }

    /*
    // MARK: - Navigation

    // In a storyboard-based application, you will often want to do a little preparation before navigation
    override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {
        // Get the new view controller using segue.destinationViewController.
        // Pass the selected object to the new view controller.
    }
    */

}
```

The most important lines are:

```swift
var storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: "First", bundle: nil)
var controller = storyboard.instantiateInitialViewController() as! UIViewController
addChildViewController(controller)
view.addSubview(controller.view)
controller.didMoveToParentViewController(self)
```

These are the 5 lines of code that you'll use when wanting to use a separate storyboard and load it into
your tab.

> Note: In newer versions of XCode 8.3+ you will be required to have `as!` instead of just `as` for the
casting. The project I push to Github (at end) is for XCode 8.2 which uses the older `as` version without the exclamation.

## Step 5: Rinse, Lather, and Repeat

From here you now know how to add a new separate storyboard for each tab. All you have to do is add a new
Storyboard and View Controller which I generally call `TabViewController` prefaced with some name to
describe the section. This `TabViewController` will help link your main storyboard to the separate storyboard!
I've gone ahead and repeated this for the second controller as well and set that background to green.

> Note: You can actually create your own parent class of `TabViewController` to house all the logic of loading
the storyboard and adding the new storyboard as a child of the `TabBarController` and thus simplify the coding!
I did not do this in the example to allow you to see the code in action.

You can see the example project on my Github by [clicking here][github]! Let me know if you have any
questions and good luck! Below you can see the final product in a GIF format:

## Why This Way?

I'm not sure if it is necessary to discuss what happened in this tutorial but I thought I'd bring a
bit of my thoughts into the post. In the beginning, a partner and I were working on a project which
had 5 tabs and we had all the UI in the `Main.storyboard`. This file took a bit to load and whenever
we both modified some UI elements, we had to worry about merges which are not easy. Thus I set out
to actually figure out how to separate out the storyboards so that we could have a more modular
project.

My first instinct was to just try to programmatically add the Tab Bar Controller, but then I thought
this would be too much work because we already had things started. I still think it's nice to have
the storyboard with the `TabBarController` because it allows us to add segues or at least get a
visual feel of the application we are designing rather than having it all in code.

It seemed only logically that I needed to attach a view controller in `Main.storyboard` in order to
get the proper tab nesting with the `TabBarController`. If I did not have this, I could easily program
for example buttons or programmed segues to load the storyboards instead; however, I think that
this tutorial universally helps understand using separate storyboards due to the extra steps needed
to work with the `TabBarController`.

I do still wonder if this is the correct way to do it, so let me know if there is a better way or if
you have a different way and want to discuss the differences or pros/cons! Thanks and hope you enjoyed
this tutorial!
