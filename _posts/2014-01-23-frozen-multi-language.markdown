Frozen was such a nice movie! I love the animation style for it, very much
like Tangled! And the characters are so cute and this time, the music was very
catchy! I highly enjoyed the jokes and although the storyline wasn't my
favorite, it still has the charm to make it a classic in my books. Anyways,
I just wanted to share the multi-language version of "Let It Go" as I highly
enjoyed it:

Isn't that nice?! At first I actually didn't enjoy this song but it grew on me
especially considering how catchy it can be! Plus Idina Menzel performing the
original is absolutely amazing! I've seen other covers but she definitely pulls
off the song so beautifully and her range is ridiculous as always! Let me know
what you think!
