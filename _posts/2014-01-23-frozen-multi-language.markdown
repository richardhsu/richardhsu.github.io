Frozen was such a nice movie! I love the animation style for it, very much
like Tangled! And the characters are so cute and this time, the music was very
catchy! I highly enjoyed the jokes and although the storyline wasn't my
favorite, it still has the charm to make it a classic in my books. Anyways,
I just wanted to share the multi-language version of "Let It Go" as I highly
enjoyed it:
