"Are you ready kids? Aye, aye, captain!" ... these words echo through my room
every now and then when I'm eating a meal or preparing to go to bed. I don't
know many "adults" who watch "Spongebob Squarepants", but I do know, this may
not be normal. I don't even know how many actually know this but I'm pretty
immature. I like to watch cartoons (two of my favorites are "Spongebob
Squarepants" and "Phineas and Ferb") and by cartoons, I mean cartoons aimed
at kids. I do watch other animated TV shows such as "Futurama", "Family Guy",
"Archer", but those of course are for "mature" audiences. I think a good reason
cartoons maintain a presence in my life is because of my little brother who is
14 years younger. Thus cartoons have pretty much dominated my life on TV. But
one thing I know for sure, cartoons help me relax at the end of the day. I love
normal TV shows but the suspense, the drama, etc, all make me want to think,
imagine, and discuss. With cartoons, I pretty much just sit back, relax and let
my mind go blank and consume the entertainment. It's quite frightening to think
about. Maybe it's lowering my IQ every single time ...

I want to think my IQ isn't decreasing but I do think I am more easily
distracted and have a difficult time focusing when I'm not in a full crunch
mode with work. I also find myself not willing to put in extra effort at times
when I know if I put in my all, that I could easily accomplish the tasks at
hand. Alas, I enjoy the cartoons. I watch "Spongebob Squarepants" as I end up
clearing my mind and immersing myself in a different world. I don't have to
think, I don't have to talk, I can just watch. "Phineas and Ferb" on the other
hand is wonderfully imaginative. I love the inventions and the double storyline
that flows through each episode. It reminds me a lot of "Dexter's Labratory" as
that too had double storyline with Monkey and also had some pretty imaginative
stuff going on.

To be honest, I don't know where I was going with this post. I merely wanted
to express how I spend some of my free time. I don't know others who do this
but all I know is that I think it helps me. Maybe I should avoid "Spongebob
Squarepants" though because it has gotten a lot worse in my opinion. The level
of "stupidity" present with the characters sometimes goes too far that I don't
like having my brother watch it because I think it'll influence him in a
negative way.

Well, if there is anyone reading my blog, what are your thoughts? What do you do
in your free time to clear your mind and relax?
