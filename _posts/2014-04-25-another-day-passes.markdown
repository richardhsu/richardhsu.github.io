Another day passes by and I forget to write. Or more than just forget, I do not
even think about writing. I really do want to actively write and have share
things but it seems difficult to always find a subject to talk about, find the
time to write, and get it done!

<!--more-->

The past few weeks since my last update have been really nice, in general, I
feel more productive in general and by that I mean:

* I've been getting my assignments completed in a timely fashion.
* I haven't been stressing too badly.
* I've been getting 7-8 hours of sleep a day.
* I am exercising more regularly though not consistently yet.
* I'm more organized and relaxed with what I do.
* I've been playing a lot of video games.

It's been really great! I've run a total of 10 miles this month so far (I know,
I don't run much yet but 1-2 miles each time is pretty good)! I feel really
great and have been weight lifting and playing tennis too. I think that feeling
of endorphins really kick in nicely to make me more productive on those days.

Sadly, I've been playing a lot of video games now. I should probably cut back,
I'm pretty sure I average like 15 hours of gaming a week which is pretty bad,
maybe I should just get another part-time job! Just kidding, I think the
relaxation is good, but I should cut back. Moderation is key and living a more
balanced life will be healthier. I should allocate some of that time to reading
and working on side projects.

That being said, I really need more side projects to work on. I have few in mind
and they are mostly to just learn different things and get myself busy. I like
being busy but it's mostly when I'm the most busy with school work. It's the
procrastination that kicks in that we all have! I am always motivated to just
learn and do *other* things besides my school work when I am near the deadlines.
However, I'd rather play video games or tennis in my spare time. I really don't
like that feeling.

I promise to write more! It'll be more on everything and anything that I hope
will be meaningful to my life and maybe help others or inform others or just
be entertaining. At the very least, it'll be a partial journal of my life.
