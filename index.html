  <p>This is a response piece written in response to
<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/230333">Forget Setting Goals. Focus on This Instead.</a> written by James Clear
on Entrepreneur. This is an old article as it was written December 17, 2013 but
I just saw it on a friend&#39;s Facebook wall. While reading the article, it struck
me the wrong way which is odd because I clearly agree with his ultimate &quot;goal&quot;
(no pun intended). But don&#39;t get me wrong, James Clear had some really great
points that I wanted to address! I won&#39;t cover everything he discussed but will
try to cover some important ones!

  <p>This month has been really crazy. Finally moved in with my girlfriend and have
most everything unpacked. She still has a lot to unpack but she&#39;s waiting as
there are a ton of other things still to be moved up. We have a sofa arriving
this weekend too and man does it feel nice. I&#39;ve also gotten sick which has
sucked a whole week out of my life. Actually more but it&#39;s also sucked 2-3
weeks of my girlfriend&#39;s life.

  <p>After moving into a new apartment, I found that the shower head was really
weak. The flow was so bad that instead of taking a 5-10 minute shower, I think
I took a 30 minute shower just so I could wash off all the soap. After
looking online, I decided maybe buying a new shower head would be good.
That&#39;s where things got interesting ... I learned a lot of more real world
lessons than in school.

  <p>Welcome, to ... &quot;The Real World&quot;. It&#39;s finally happened! I&#39;ve completed my
schooling and am now working! It&#39;s great, though this transition has been
pretty stressful. After graduating, I moved a lot of stuff to my new place
and am still unpacking. At work, there&#39;s a lot of onboarding material to
review such as policies, benefits, and team projects. I feel slightly
overwhelmed by everything but I still feel ready to go but extremely tired
by the end of the day. Maybe it&#39;s the student in me that still likes to get
my work and still likes the stress.

  <p>Apartment hunting can be stressful and a pain. I finished finding an apartment
for the next chapter in my life and needless to say, there were a lot of
questions that made the process so much easier! My girlfriend and I probably
spent over 40+ hours looking online for apartments, making appointments,
visiting, asking questions, looking around, and making decisions. And there were
a lot of things to remember that even in retrospect we still had some questions
that we wish had been answered right away. The best thing to do is always have
a contact number or email address of someone in the leasing office so that
in the worst case, you can contact them with more questions!
