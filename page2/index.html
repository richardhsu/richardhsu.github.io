  <p>Javascript is a funny language. I rarely find myself going &quot;oh that makes sense&quot;
, but then again when I think about all the rules and structures of the
language, it does make sense. Of course, I&#39;m not justifying the language
decisions, just that based on the design of the language, the outcomes make
sense.

  <p>Things have gotten a lot busier in school. Longer grading periods, more reading,
longer assignments, but I always make time for unwinding at least once a day. My
main source of unwinding is playing <a href="http://www.battlefield.com/">Battlefield 4</a>. If you play, this
weekend there&#39;s actually a Double XP Boost going on for Player Appreciation
Month, which by the way was only announced on Facebook and seems very odd that
no official announcement was made on the actual <a href="http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/">Battlelog</a> website.
Anyways, although it is a fun game it can be stressful but in a good way ...
until we get to the frustrations of it all.

The game can be very buggy at times and it can get quite annoying when I&#39;m just
trying to have fun. I&#39;m okay with the stresses generated by the gameplay of
attacking an objective with enemies ready to swarm in and kill. I&#39;m okay with
the stresses of being shocked around a corner by a shotgun. But playing a game
in which bugs introduce possible preceived unfairness is not okay. But then
again when I think about how massive this game is with at least one server
and near 64 or more participants, I am inspired by how such a game even
functions to begin with!

  <p>I use Kindle heavily for reference books and normal books across many devices
and for some reason, I always have issues with the Mac version of Kindle reader.
For some reason my purchased books do not always appear in my library. These are
the non-downloaded versions so I can&#39;t download them because I can&#39;t see them.

I&#39;ve found a fix that although can be annoying, works so far 100% of the
time. All you have to do is go to <code>Kindle &gt; Preferences</code> and then <strong>Deregister</strong>
your account and re-register! Now all your books should appear in your library
for you to download! I&#39;ve had to do this a couple of times which is annoying but
at least it works! Hope they fix this issue!

  <p>I&#39;ve been rewatching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych">Psych</a> on Netflix as my way to relieve stress from
the daily workday. It&#39;s been great and then yesterday I watched an episode that
really hit some interest bones. The episode contained:

<ol>
<li>Kenan Thompson who was hilarious in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_That">All That</a></li>
<li>Jaleel White who made the whole of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters">Family Matters</a></li>
<li>Acapella singing which I do enjoy and wish I could sing and be part of a
quartet or something.</li>
<li>Computer Security and Networking references which I&#39;ll discuss.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ninja">American Ninja</a> which hilariously, I didn&#39;t understand the name drop reference
because I never knew the actor&#39;s name so I assumed he was the director.</li>
</ol>

  <p>Well today was a failure. I missed a running day. It might be good since my
ankle wasn&#39;t feeling well over the weekend to the point that walking would be
painful. I think I&#39;ve fully recovered though so I should definitely get back to
running.

It was funny though, I had dreams of running in the morning. At least part of me
was wanting to do it. Dreams are interesting, aren&#39;t they? I remember clearly
in my dream getting out of bed and then running around the neighborhood.
Unfortunately it was easy to tell it was a dream because I didn&#39;t eat a quick
breakfast nor did I brush my teeth which I always do in the morning. The crazy
part was this dream happened 3 different times with 3 different scenarios, all
very realistic.
