  <p>Another day passes by and I forget to write. Or more than just forget, I do not
even think about writing. I really do want to actively write and have share
things but it seems difficult to always find a subject to talk about, find the
time to write, and get it done!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The past few weeks since my last update have been really nice, in general, I
feel more productive in general and by that I mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve been getting my assignments completed in a timely fashion.</li>
<li>I haven&#39;t been stressing too badly.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve been getting 7-8 hours of sleep a day.</li>
<li>I am exercising more regularly though not consistently yet.</li>
<li>I&#39;m more organized and relaxed with what I do.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve been playing a lot of video games.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s been really great! I&#39;ve run a total of 10 miles this month so far (I know,
I don&#39;t run much yet but 1-2 miles each time is pretty good)! I feel really
great and have been weight lifting and playing tennis too. I think that feeling
of endorphins really kick in nicely to make me more productive on those days.</p>

<p>Sadly, I&#39;ve been playing a lot of video games now. I should probably cut back,
I&#39;m pretty sure I average like 15 hours of gaming a week which is pretty bad,
maybe I should just get another part-time job! Just kidding, I think the
relaxation is good, but I should cut back. Moderation is key and living a more
balanced life will be healthier. I should allocate some of that time to reading
and working on side projects.</p>

<p>That being said, I really need more side projects to work on. I have few in mind
and they are mostly to just learn different things and get myself busy. I like
being busy but it&#39;s mostly when I&#39;m the most busy with school work. It&#39;s the
procrastination that kicks in that we all have! I am always motivated to just
learn and do <em>other</em> things besides my school work when I am near the deadlines.
However, I&#39;d rather play video games or tennis in my spare time. I really don&#39;t
like that feeling.</p>

<p>I promise to write more! It&#39;ll be more on everything and anything that I hope
will be meaningful to my life and maybe help others or inform others or just
be entertaining. At the very least, it&#39;ll be a partial journal of my life.</p>
