  <p>I&#39;ve been rewatching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych">Psych</a> on Netflix as my way to relieve stress from
the daily workday. It&#39;s been great and then yesterday I watched an episode that
really hit some interest bones. The episode contained:</p>

<ol>
<li>Kenan Thompson who was hilarious in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_That">All That</a></li>
<li>Jaleel White who made the whole of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters">Family Matters</a></li>
<li>Acapella singing which I do enjoy and wish I could sing and be part of a
quartet or something.</li>
<li>Computer Security and Networking references which I&#39;ll discuss.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ninja">American Ninja</a> which hilariously, I didn&#39;t understand the name drop reference
because I never knew the actor&#39;s name so I assumed he was the director.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most episodes, I just enjoy for the comedy and the crime solving but this one
I took quite more interest because of my own interests or for nostalgia. My
biggest interest is Computer Security and Networking which I wanted to discuss!</p>

<p>First, this is the clip that just made me smile as it seemed irrelevant but quite a
drop in words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Manager: I don&#39;t suppose either of you can create an 802.1Q spanning tree loop
using auto forwarding non-Wintel based equipment?
Shawn: I can make a straw wrapper crawl like a worm. Oh, and, uh, make the
inside of my elbow look like a butt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First off, I just love the execution of Shawn&#39;s response. I always enjoyed the
witty stupid banter but seriously, it&#39;s not just the line, but the execution
that really impressed me.</p>

<p>Anyways, getting down to the point the manager states <strong>&quot;802.1Q spanning tree
loop using auto forwarding non-Wintel based equipment?&quot;</strong> to which I didn&#39;t
understand fully though I understood most of what he was getting at so I will
tackle the parts in just interest order:</p>

<ol>
<li>&quot;Non-Wintel&quot; based equipment - To be honest, I just learned a ton just now,
I looked it up and I had no idea Windows based Intel systems were called Wintel!
I learned something today which I think is something you should all do everyday!</li>
<li>&quot;Spanning tree loop&quot; - I&#39;m pretty sure this term exists but it makes no sense
at all! Spanning trees SHOULD NOT have loops! If you construct a topology with a
loop then it can still work, but if your system constructs a spanning
tree with a loop, then you have a bug! But loops in networking are difficult to
deal with as there is a lot of logic to prevent loops from crashing or
overloading the system.</li>
<li>&quot;802.1Q&quot; - I never heard of this standard but it is about VLAN which is
interesting, I wanted to just mention that there are just way too many standards
that I wish I had really awesome memory to remember everything.</li>
</ol>

<p>That&#39;s all I wanted to mention about the quote, there is the &quot;auto forwarding&quot;
but it isn&#39;t anything interesting as I assume it&#39;s just a setting or
configuration.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I really enjoyed this episode! It had some interesting twists
and didn&#39;t make it at all obvious who was the crook, but it dropped hints enough
that in the end, the pieces connect. If you haven&#39;t watched Psych, I highly
recommend it! I&#39;ve now placed it at the top of my all time favorite TV shows for
the many reasons of crime investigation, curiosity, comedy, obscure references
that I may never get, and execution.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think in the comments!</p>
