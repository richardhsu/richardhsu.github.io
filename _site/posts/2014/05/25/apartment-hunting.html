  <p>Apartment hunting can be stressful and a pain. I finished finding an apartment
for the next chapter in my life and needless to say, there were a lot of
questions that made the process so much easier! My girlfriend and I probably
spent over 40+ hours looking online for apartments, making appointments,
visiting, asking questions, looking around, and making decisions. And there were
a lot of things to remember that even in retrospect we still had some questions
that we wish had been answered right away. The best thing to do is always have
a contact number or email address of someone in the leasing office so that
in the worst case, you can contact them with more questions!</p>

<h2>Finding</h2>

<p>The following really helped in finding apartments (though driving around and
looking can be just as helpful if you have a general area you are looking at):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.padmapper.com/">Padmapper</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.apartmentfinder.com/">Apartment Finder</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.forrent.com/">For Rent</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Rating</h2>

<p>My girlfriend and I generally looked at <a href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a> reviews for the apartments
as well as <a href="http://www.apartmentratings.com/">Apartment Ratings</a> for reviews and general comments on the
places. We generally looked for the following issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Safety when inside the complex or in the neighborhood.</li>
<li>Management and how easy they are to contact and with discussing issues.</li>
<li>Noise between apartment rooms.</li>
<li>Noise outside such as traffic, airplanes, or other events.</li>
<li>Smells.</li>
<li>Rent hikes each year at end of lease.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pictures, Pictures, Pictures</h2>

<p>Take A LOT of pictures! I mean A LOT of pictures. Like really, don&#39;t skip out
on this. Do this for yourself. Take a picture of the kitchen in different
angles, take a picture of the rooms with people in it. Take a picture of the
bathroom, the cabinets, the shower, the drains, etc. Take EVERY picture that
you need!</p>

<p>Why? Because you are going to start to blend all the apartments together after
seeing different ones! Make sure you can reference back to remember what you
saw. Between my girlfriend and me we had maybe 10-20 pictures per apartment
and even then we still missed small details. I mean it! The small details are
the ones you&#39;ll want to remember when comparing apartments!</p>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<p>We were extremely careful about wording of things. Be sure you clarify what you
have to pay for or is at the management&#39;s expense such as replacing appliances
or repainting walls. When discussing, sometimes assumptions can be made but you
do NOT want to be surprised with anything when it comes to apartments as there
can be excessive fees associated with it. Some other things to bare witness to:</p>

<ul>
<li>If management offers to paint the walls, they still will charge to paint the
wall AND to restore it to original color.</li>
<li>Pet fees can be different for different types of pets (cats vs dog etc)</li>
<li>Initial payment usual requires a cashier&#39;s check or money order and NOT normal
bank checks.</li>
<li>Lease agreements may be signed separately for each adult occupant but may be
required by all parties before first person moves in.</li>
<li>Some places require a minimum income as &quot;good faith&quot; that you can pay rent so
discuss this up front before lease discussion to make sure you can work things
out!</li>
<li>Most utilities are separate so you need to find out how to get billed
properly.</li>
<li>Note on your calendar the end of your lease period and set a reminder 30 days
before that as most places require a 30 day termination notice. Maybe even more!
Otherwise you may find yourself paying month-to-month.</li>
<li>Call the Internet/Cable company about what needs to be done to get access to
such services. Some companies may need to send out a service representative to
install or get initial wiring done. Don&#39;t assume you can just get the modem
and set it up yourself. (I personally was hit with an extra $30 service fee
because apparently the apartment needed to be &quot;rewired&quot; even though the previous
tenant used the service, I got it waived after 2 hours of waiting and half an
hour of arguing at a local office).</li>
<li>Ask if there is any trial period on the apartment. Some places may have a one
month trial period in which you sign the lease but you can terminate and move
out if you are unhappy within the first 30 days with only the first month
rent and general deposit fees. Kind of like general purchase return policies!</li>
<li>This is for you! Not for anyone else, get as much information as YOU need
and it is the management&#39;s job to answer ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. They also want
to convince you to lease so make sure you are very well informed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some references to some good lists or guides that we used:</p>

</ul>

<h2>Final Words</h2>

<p>Good luck! Have fun looking at apartments and finding the one just for you! And
remember, it isn&#39;t the end of the world if you chose incorrectly. You can either
face the termination penalty or wait for the end of the lease and start looking.
But spend as much time as possible deciding! Only settle when you have all your
basic needs met!</p>
