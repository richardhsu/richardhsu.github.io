  <p>This month has been really crazy. Finally moved in with my girlfriend and have
most everything unpacked. She still has a lot to unpack but she&#39;s waiting as
there are a ton of other things still to be moved up. We have a sofa arriving
this weekend too and man does it feel nice. I&#39;ve also gotten sick which has
sucked a whole week out of my life. Actually more but it&#39;s also sucked 2-3
weeks of my girlfriend&#39;s life.

  <p>After moving into a new apartment, I found that the shower head was really
weak. The flow was so bad that instead of taking a 5-10 minute shower, I think
I took a 30 minute shower just so I could wash off all the soap. After
looking online, I decided maybe buying a new shower head would be good.
That&#39;s where things got interesting ... I learned a lot of more real world
lessons than in school.

  <p>Welcome, to ... &quot;The Real World&quot;. It&#39;s finally happened! I&#39;ve completed my
schooling and am now working! It&#39;s great, though this transition has been
pretty stressful. After graduating, I moved a lot of stuff to my new place
and am still unpacking. At work, there&#39;s a lot of onboarding material to
review such as policies, benefits, and team projects. I feel slightly
overwhelmed by everything but I still feel ready to go but extremely tired
by the end of the day. Maybe it&#39;s the student in me that still likes to get
my work and still likes the stress.

  <p>Apartment hunting can be stressful and a pain. I finished finding an apartment
for the next chapter in my life and needless to say, there were a lot of
questions that made the process so much easier! My girlfriend and I probably
spent over 40+ hours looking online for apartments, making appointments,
visiting, asking questions, looking around, and making decisions. And there were
a lot of things to remember that even in retrospect we still had some questions
that we wish had been answered right away. The best thing to do is always have
a contact number or email address of someone in the leasing office so that
in the worst case, you can contact them with more questions!

  <p>Just finished making some simple updates to my blog, if you haven&#39;t noticed! I
learned a bit more about the Jekyll process and having plugins with GitHub
pages. It&#39;s a fairly easy task to do, never realized it was so easy! I learned
the process from <a href="http://davidensinger.com/2013/07/automating-jekyll-deployment-to-github-pages-with-rake/">David Ensinger&#39;s</a> website which is really nicely done and
since he uses GitHub as well, it was cool to read the code and see what was
created!
