  <p>&quot;Are you ready kids? Aye, aye, captain!&quot; ... these words echo through my room
every now and then when I&#39;m eating a meal or preparing to go to bed. I don&#39;t
know many &quot;adults&quot; who watch &quot;Spongebob Squarepants&quot;, but I do know, this may
not be normal. I don&#39;t even know how many actually know this but I&#39;m pretty
immature. I like to watch cartoons (two of my favorites are &quot;Spongebob
Squarepants&quot; and &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;) and by cartoons, I mean cartoons aimed
at kids. I do watch other animated TV shows such as &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;,
&quot;Archer&quot;, but those of course are for &quot;mature&quot; audiences. I think a good reason
cartoons maintain a presence in my life is because of my little brother who is
14 years younger. Thus cartoons have pretty much dominated my life on TV. But
one thing I know for sure, cartoons help me relax at the end of the day. I love
normal TV shows but the suspense, the drama, etc, all make me want to think,
imagine, and discuss. With cartoons, I pretty much just sit back, relax and let
my mind go blank and consume the entertainment. It&#39;s quite frightening to think
about. Maybe it&#39;s lowering my IQ every single time ...

  <p>Another day passes by and I forget to write. Or more than just forget, I do not
even think about writing. I really do want to actively write and have share
things but it seems difficult to always find a subject to talk about, find the
time to write, and get it done!

  <p>Ruby Version Manager (RVM) and OS X Mavericks can be painful. Though if you use
Ruby then you should use RVM so hopefully this guide can help. There&#39;s a lot of
issues with getting it to work. I am a course assistant for the Web Applications
course at Stanford University and we have students install RVM, Ruby, and Rails
and there have been so many issues that I thought I&#39;d make a post. I can&#39;t
guarantee that this will work but I&#39;ve tested it many times for OS X Mavericks
that I believe it should work!

  <p>Javascript is a funny language. I rarely find myself going &quot;oh that makes sense&quot;
, but then again when I think about all the rules and structures of the
language, it does make sense. Of course, I&#39;m not justifying the language
decisions, just that based on the design of the language, the outcomes make
sense.

  <p>Things have gotten a lot busier in school. Longer grading periods, more reading,
longer assignments, but I always make time for unwinding at least once a day. My
main source of unwinding is playing <a href="http://www.battlefield.com/">Battlefield 4</a>. If you play, this
weekend there&#39;s actually a Double XP Boost going on for Player Appreciation
Month, which by the way was only announced on Facebook and seems very odd that
no official announcement was made on the actual <a href="http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/">Battlelog</a> website.
Anyways, although it is a fun game it can be stressful but in a good way ...
until we get to the frustrations of it all.

The game can be very buggy at times and it can get quite annoying when I&#39;m just
trying to have fun. I&#39;m okay with the stresses generated by the gameplay of
attacking an objective with enemies ready to swarm in and kill. I&#39;m okay with
the stresses of being shocked around a corner by a shotgun. But playing a game
in which bugs introduce possible preceived unfairness is not okay. But then
again when I think about how massive this game is with at least one server
and near 64 or more participants, I am inspired by how such a game even
functions to begin with!
