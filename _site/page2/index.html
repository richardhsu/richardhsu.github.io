  <p>I&#39;ve been working with <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt">Control Groups</a> recently to investigate a performance issue. I have not found a
solution yet but will post again if that does happen! As for CGroups, I came across an issue that although simple
if I just read the documentation, didn&#39;t seem obvious by the error:
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="o">[</span>Errno 28] No space left on device

  <p>The proverb &quot;Slow and steady wins the race&quot; echoes through my mind as every day passes. I can feel myself in the lull
of my life. I feel extremely calm and collected even when there are a ton of things racing through my mind or even in
my life. I can consider myself lucky to be in this place of peace and happiness but at the same time, I know I need
to remind myself that I need to keep taking a step forward every single day otherwise I will not go far in life. I
have goals that I know cannot be achieved in one day. &quot;Slow and steady wins the race.&quot;

  <p>I totally forgot to post about this, but I ran 3 miles on the treadmill with an average pace of 10 minutes! It was
last Tuesday so September 23, 2014. I decided to just attempt running 3 miles again which I haven&#39;t done in awhile.
It was exciting to have hit the mark fairly easily. For the most part the first 2 miles were a breeze at 6 mph and
toward the 2.5 mile mark was when I started getting tired and a bit cramped at the knees. But I still trudged through
and upon hitting 3 miles, I celebrated inside!

  <p>Time sure does fly! Almost 2 months since I last posted and a lot has happened! Life has been good but also stressful.
I only hope that time slows down soon so I can take a deep breath and soak in life and invest in my future. I doubt
it will happen as so much change is occurring. It may not be until next year that things begin to settle into a nice
cadence. At the very least, I hope I feel like I&#39;m soaring as time flies passed me. But I&#39;d like to at least update on
what has happened!

  <p>This is a response piece written in response to
<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/230333">Forget Setting Goals. Focus on This Instead.</a> written by James Clear
on Entrepreneur. This is an old article as it was written December 17, 2013 but
I just saw it on a friend&#39;s Facebook wall. While reading the article, it struck
me the wrong way which is odd because I clearly agree with his ultimate &quot;goal&quot;
(no pun intended). But don&#39;t get me wrong, James Clear had some really great
points that I wanted to address! I won&#39;t cover everything he discussed but will
try to cover some important ones!
