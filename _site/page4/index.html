  <p>Just finished making some simple updates to my blog, if you haven&#39;t noticed! I
learned a bit more about the Jekyll process and having plugins with GitHub
pages. It&#39;s a fairly easy task to do, never realized it was so easy! I learned
the process from <a href="http://davidensinger.com/2013/07/automating-jekyll-deployment-to-github-pages-with-rake/">David Ensinger&#39;s</a> website which is really nicely done and
since he uses GitHub as well, it was cool to read the code and see what was
created!

  <p>Beginning of this year my friends and I tried to run on a regular basis.
Originally our plan was to run in the morning on specific days and for the most
part we did pretty well. We were on schedule and then work would just hit us
all that waking up in the mornings became difficult or pretty much impossible.
We&#39;ve since given up scheduling it but I&#39;ve maintained trying to exercise at
a more consistent schedule so I&#39;d call on them on the days I felt I could run
and generally speaking at least one would be able to join. I&#39;m pleased to share
that even though we didn&#39;t run consistently, I&#39;ve been getting into a better
groove and I think that&#39;s the most important thing. I still haven&#39;t reached
my goal of running 5 miles non-stop by the time I graduate in June but I&#39;m
almost there!

  <p>&quot;Are you ready kids? Aye, aye, captain!&quot; ... these words echo through my room
every now and then when I&#39;m eating a meal or preparing to go to bed. I don&#39;t
know many &quot;adults&quot; who watch &quot;Spongebob Squarepants&quot;, but I do know, this may
not be normal. I don&#39;t even know how many actually know this but I&#39;m pretty
immature. I like to watch cartoons (two of my favorites are &quot;Spongebob
Squarepants&quot; and &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;) and by cartoons, I mean cartoons aimed
at kids. I do watch other animated TV shows such as &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;,
&quot;Archer&quot;, but those of course are for &quot;mature&quot; audiences. I think a good reason
cartoons maintain a presence in my life is because of my little brother who is
14 years younger. Thus cartoons have pretty much dominated my life on TV. But
one thing I know for sure, cartoons help me relax at the end of the day. I love
normal TV shows but the suspense, the drama, etc, all make me want to think,
imagine, and discuss. With cartoons, I pretty much just sit back, relax and let
my mind go blank and consume the entertainment. It&#39;s quite frightening to think
about. Maybe it&#39;s lowering my IQ every single time ...

  <p>Another day passes by and I forget to write. Or more than just forget, I do not
even think about writing. I really do want to actively write and have share
things but it seems difficult to always find a subject to talk about, find the
time to write, and get it done!

  <p>Ruby Version Manager (RVM) and OS X Mavericks can be painful. Though if you use
Ruby then you should use RVM so hopefully this guide can help. There&#39;s a lot of
issues with getting it to work. I am a course assistant for the Web Applications
course at Stanford University and we have students install RVM, Ruby, and Rails
and there have been so many issues that I thought I&#39;d make a post. I can&#39;t
guarantee that this will work but I&#39;ve tested it many times for OS X Mavericks
that I believe it should work!
