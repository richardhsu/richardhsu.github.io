  <p>Beginning of this year my friends and I tried to run on a regular basis.
Originally our plan was to run in the morning on specific days and for the most
part we did pretty well. We were on schedule and then work would just hit us
all that waking up in the mornings became difficult or pretty much impossible.
We&#39;ve since given up scheduling it but I&#39;ve maintained trying to exercise at
a more consistent schedule so I&#39;d call on them on the days I felt I could run
and generally speaking at least one would be able to join. I&#39;m pleased to share
that even though we didn&#39;t run consistently, I&#39;ve been getting into a better
groove and I think that&#39;s the most important thing. I still haven&#39;t reached
my goal of running 5 miles non-stop by the time I graduate in June but I&#39;m
almost there!

  <p>Another day passes by and I forget to write. Or more than just forget, I do not
even think about writing. I really do want to actively write and have share
things but it seems difficult to always find a subject to talk about, find the
time to write, and get it done!

  <p>Well today was a failure. I missed a running day. It might be good since my
ankle wasn&#39;t feeling well over the weekend to the point that walking would be
painful. I think I&#39;ve fully recovered though so I should definitely get back to
running.

It was funny though, I had dreams of running in the morning. At least part of me
was wanting to do it. Dreams are interesting, aren&#39;t they? I remember clearly
in my dream getting out of bed and then running around the neighborhood.
Unfortunately it was easy to tell it was a dream because I didn&#39;t eat a quick
breakfast nor did I brush my teeth which I always do in the morning. The crazy
part was this dream happened 3 different times with 3 different scenarios, all
very realistic.

  <p>One of my friends proposed we jog in the mornings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I,
being of the sane mind, decided this would be a good start to the new year. Of
course the biggest barrier was that I never really jogged much as exercise in
the past. I&#39;ve gone on treadmills and done cardio exercises such as jumping
jacks and other various routines, but these were very small bursts throughout
my life. My treadmill days would be very infrequent and so starting a jogging
routine at 7:15 AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays seemed daunting, but I really
wanted to get in shape.
