  <p>The proverb &quot;Slow and steady wins the race&quot; echoes through my mind as every day passes. I can feel myself in the lull
of my life. I feel extremely calm and collected even when there are a ton of things racing through my mind or even in
my life. I can consider myself lucky to be in this place of peace and happiness but at the same time, I know I need
to remind myself that I need to keep taking a step forward every single day otherwise I will not go far in life. I
have goals that I know cannot be achieved in one day. &quot;Slow and steady wins the race.&quot;

  <p>I totally forgot to post about this, but I ran 3 miles on the treadmill with an average pace of 10 minutes! It was
last Tuesday so September 23, 2014. I decided to just attempt running 3 miles again which I haven&#39;t done in awhile.
It was exciting to have hit the mark fairly easily. For the most part the first 2 miles were a breeze at 6 mph and
toward the 2.5 mile mark was when I started getting tired and a bit cramped at the knees. But I still trudged through
and upon hitting 3 miles, I celebrated inside!

  <p>Beginning of this year my friends and I tried to run on a regular basis.
Originally our plan was to run in the morning on specific days and for the most
part we did pretty well. We were on schedule and then work would just hit us
all that waking up in the mornings became difficult or pretty much impossible.
We&#39;ve since given up scheduling it but I&#39;ve maintained trying to exercise at
a more consistent schedule so I&#39;d call on them on the days I felt I could run
and generally speaking at least one would be able to join. I&#39;m pleased to share
that even though we didn&#39;t run consistently, I&#39;ve been getting into a better
groove and I think that&#39;s the most important thing. I still haven&#39;t reached
my goal of running 5 miles non-stop by the time I graduate in June but I&#39;m
almost there!

  <p>Another day passes by and I forget to write. Or more than just forget, I do not
even think about writing. I really do want to actively write and have share
things but it seems difficult to always find a subject to talk about, find the
time to write, and get it done!

  <p>Well today was a failure. I missed a running day. It might be good since my
ankle wasn&#39;t feeling well over the weekend to the point that walking would be
painful. I think I&#39;ve fully recovered though so I should definitely get back to
running.

It was funny though, I had dreams of running in the morning. At least part of me
was wanting to do it. Dreams are interesting, aren&#39;t they? I remember clearly
in my dream getting out of bed and then running around the neighborhood.
Unfortunately it was easy to tell that it was a dream because I didn&#39;t eat a
quick breakfast nor did I brush my teeth which I always do in the morning.
The crazy part was this dream happened 3 different times with 3 different
scenarios, all very realistic.
