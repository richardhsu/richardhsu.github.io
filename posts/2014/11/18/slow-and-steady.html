  <p>The proverb &quot;Slow and steady wins the race&quot; echoes through my mind as every day passes. I can feel myself in the lull
of my life. I feel extremely calm and collected even when there are a ton of things racing through my mind or even in
my life. I can consider myself lucky to be in this place of peace and happiness but at the same time, I know I need
to remind myself that I need to keep taking a step forward every single day otherwise I will not go far in life. I
have goals that I know cannot be achieved in one day. &quot;Slow and steady wins the race.&quot;</p>

<h2>Running</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the year, I started running. You can see that I&#39;ve mostly talked about running in my blog thus far
and have 5 posts before this about running. Hopefully it shows some progress! (I think it does). I put it to myself to
make sure I ran and live a healthier life style. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t eat as healthy as I used to, but I try to
still be mindful to get my fruits and vegetables! But that&#39;s another story. I wanted to focus on exercising regularly.</p>

<p>The year is almost over and I&#39;m fairly proud of how much I&#39;ve exercised. It isn&#39;t the greatest, I assumed by this time
I would be exercising 3+ times a week, but I&#39;m still going only 2-3 times a week. But I wanted to quickly review what
I&#39;ve achieved:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve brought down my mile time from 10-11 minutes to 8 minutes! Yes that&#39;s right, I can now run a mile in a little
over 8 minutes. Generally at the 8:05-8:10 range! With my best time being 7:56! (Caveat: This is on a treadmill, but
I think it&#39;s still worthy of some pride!)</li>
<li>I can run 3 miles at 6mph fairly consistently now without trouble! I&#39;m excited because 1 mile used to be daunting
and now 3 miles is just ... BORING! :P Yes, I said it with a hint of &quot;this is easy&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m getting hella bored.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m very excited for the new year. Although I don&#39;t usually make New Year&#39;s Resolutions anymore, I know for 2015, I
will have the following resolution set in stone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Run a 10K before 2016 and actually finish it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know, it may seem easy to many of you, but 6 miles seems daunting to me still even if 3 miles is boring. I know at
the end of 3 miles, I am still fairly tired, but I think the biggest issue is that I get bored at around 2 miles. I may
need to find some good music to listen to during the runs. A 10K will take me an hour to complete and for an hour, I&#39;m
definitely going to need something to distract me!</p>

<p>If you have any tips on running for such a long distance and not getting bored, I&#39;d love to hear about them because
seriously, I&#39;ll need them!</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>I feel like I&#39;ve hit a wall in my professional development. Work has been great and I am learning a lot but I think I
am missing the aspect of learning new technologies and experimenting with new things. The past month, I&#39;ve been
working on a performance issue that is currently a stumper. I hope to write about it later, but for now, I will just
say that I am learning more about more about the kernel and the workings of the operating systems from a &quot;real world&quot;
perspective rather than from the academic side of implementing running queues.</p>

<p>It&#39;s challenging and exciting but at the same time, I can feel my development skills at a complete stop. This needs
to change. I will need to keep in mind that this won&#39;t change in the next 24 hours but I should work toward a brighter
future every single day. I have been trying to work into my schedule time to read, work on random problems from math
problems to programming problems, to learning something new.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been motivated a lot recently but can easily find myself stressed or tired that I prevent myself from trying to
improve every day. I think if I can slowly make progress, I will eventually start moving at a faster pace, just like
with my running. Just have to remember &quot;Slow and steady wins the race.&quot;</p>
