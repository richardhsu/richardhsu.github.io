  <p>&quot;Are you ready kids? Aye, aye, captain!&quot; ... these words echo through my room
every now and then when I&#39;m eating a meal or preparing to go to bed. I don&#39;t
know many &quot;adults&quot; who watch &quot;Spongebob Squarepants&quot;, but I do know, this may
not be normal. I don&#39;t even know how many actually know this but I&#39;m pretty
immature. I like to watch cartoons (two of my favorites are &quot;Spongebob
Squarepants&quot; and &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;) and by cartoons, I mean cartoons aimed
at kids. I do watch other animated TV shows such as &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;,
&quot;Archer&quot;, but those of course are for &quot;mature&quot; audiences. I think a good reason
cartoons maintain a presence in my life is because of my little brother who is
14 years younger. Thus cartoons have pretty much dominated my life on TV. But
one thing I know for sure, cartoons help me relax at the end of the day. I love
normal TV shows but the suspense, the drama, etc, all make me want to think,
imagine, and discuss. With cartoons, I pretty much just sit back, relax and let
my mind go blank and consume the entertainment. It&#39;s quite frightening to think
about. Maybe it&#39;s lowering my IQ every single time ...</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I want to think my IQ isn&#39;t decreasing but I do think I am more easily
distracted and have a difficult time focusing when I&#39;m not in a full crunch
mode with work. I also find myself not willing to put in extra effort at times
when I know if I put in my all, that I could easily accomplish the tasks at
hand. Alas, I enjoy the cartoons. I watch &quot;Spongebob Squarepants&quot; as I end up
clearing my mind and immersing myself in a different world. I don&#39;t have to
think, I don&#39;t have to talk, I can just watch. &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; on the other
hand is wonderfully imaginative. I love the inventions and the double storyline
that flows through each episode. It reminds me a lot of &quot;Dexter&#39;s Labratory&quot; as
that too had double storyline with Monkey and also had some pretty imaginative
stuff going on.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don&#39;t know where I was going with this post. I merely wanted
to express how I spend some of my free time. I don&#39;t know others who do this
but all I know is that I think it helps me. Maybe I should avoid &quot;Spongebob
Squarepants&quot; though because it has gotten a lot worse in my opinion. The level
of &quot;stupidity&quot; present with the characters sometimes goes too far that I don&#39;t
like having my brother watch it because I think it&#39;ll influence him in a
negative way.</p>

<p>Well, if there is anyone reading my blog, what are your thoughts? What do you do
in your free time to clear your mind and relax?</p>
