  <p>Welcome, to ... &quot;The Real World&quot;. It&#39;s finally happened! I&#39;ve completed my
schooling and am now working! It&#39;s great, though this transition has been
pretty stressful. After graduating, I moved a lot of stuff to my new place
and am still unpacking. At work, there&#39;s a lot of onboarding material to
review such as policies, benefits, and team projects. I feel slightly
overwhelmed by everything but I still feel ready to go but extremely tired
by the end of the day. Maybe it&#39;s the student in me that still likes to get
my work and still likes the stress.</p>

<h2>Schedules</h2>

<p>The schedules are different too. As a student there is more time but at
the same time there is a constant amount of stress because you have
classes and deadlines that are generally within a week. At work there
are still deadlines but at least for now, once I get home, I can relax
a bit and do what I want to do. The only downside is that the time is
chunked and thus I feel like all I want to do is relax when I get home
rather than do side projects or anything that may require my brain to
think. As a student the free time was spaced out such that I could
have some time to relax and then other times could actually work on
various other things. I will state now that I enjoyed student life a lot
more but hated the stress it created. I love working life because
the stress is actually exciting and motivating and not downers. Maybe
that&#39;ll change once I get a performance review ...</p>

<h2>Unpacking</h2>

<p>Oh man, unpacking is such a pain, especially when I don&#39;t have much
furniture. I have all these boxes everywhere and a table of random
small things here and there. I feel tired at the end of the day that
organizing seems to become stressful too! But I want to get it done
and don&#39;t want to get it done at the same time. It&#39;s crazy!</p>

<h2>New Beginnings</h2>

<p>I&#39;m extremely excited for this new chapter in my life though! I have
a Master&#39;s degree but I don&#39;t feel any different. I&#39;ve learned a lot
but I don&#39;t feel different as I think learning will always happen!
I&#39;m so excited to explore new things and in my spare time work on
side projects and have fun and actually hang out with friends more
without worrying about projects or assignments or readings! Here&#39;s
to new beginnings! My first fun event:
<a href="http://roomescapeadventures.com/">Trapped in a Room with a Zombie</a>
with 6 other friends! Super excited :D</p>
