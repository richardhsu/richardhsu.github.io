  <p>I totally forgot to post about this, but I ran 3 miles on the treadmill with an average pace of 10 minutes! It was
last Tuesday so September 23, 2014. I decided to just attempt running 3 miles again which I haven&#39;t done in awhile.
It was exciting to have hit the mark fairly easily. For the most part the first 2 miles were a breeze at 6 mph and
toward the 2.5 mile mark was when I started getting tired and a bit cramped at the knees. But I still trudged through
and upon hitting 3 miles, I celebrated inside!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Generally my workout routine consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>30 seconds of power walking at 3 mph.</li>
<li>Complete to 1 mile at 7 mph.</li>
<li>30 seconds of power walking at 3 mph cooldown.</li>
<li>Lift weights or do ab workouts.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ve been more consistent at doing this every Tuesday and Thursday and with some workout buddies at work. I&#39;m really
happy of the progress that I&#39;ve made. Generally I would do something simple. I hope starting October, that I will
pick up the pace a bit more with a possible run at the end of my workout, and heavier weights.</p>

<p>Anyways, on Tuesday, September 23, 2014, I went by myself since my coworker caught a cold and so I decided to just spend
the time running. And my mind was funny, it said &quot;Run 3 miles!&quot;. So I did! I hadn&#39;t in a long time, but I knew I could
do it! I decided to just pace myself at 6 mph so that I&#39;d hit 10 min per mile which is a huge improvement from my
previous runs that go 2+ miles long. In the past, I would run and walk, but this time I went consistently at 6 mph.
The treadmill helps a lot considering if this were outdoors, I wouldn&#39;t be able to be as consistent.</p>

<p>I clearly remember just not wanting to look at the distance and the first time I took a glance I had gone 1.2 miles.
Then 1.8 miles, then 2.5 miles. At that point, I couldn&#39;t help it, I was actually tired at my knees. I pushed myself
a bit too much but I think that it is for the better. Hitting the 3 mile mark was so rewarding that I felt that I had
made progress!</p>

<p>Overall, I can now run the mile in roughly 8 minutes and 30 seconds which is minutes ahead of my high school records!
Still not good enough, really want to be doing 7 minute miles as my main goal! Now that I know I can run 3 miles with
an average pace of 10 minutes per mile, I am extremely happy. I could remember in the past that doing such would
require running and then walking, running then walking, and even then I would not have completed it in 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Anyways, I just wanted to update on my progress and that I am motivated to reach my goals! I hope to do a 5k or even
10k run sometime! That&#39;ll be a 2015 goal! You heard it here :P</p>
