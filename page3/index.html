  <p>Well today was a failure. I missed a running day. It might be good since my
ankle wasn&#39;t feeling well over the weekend to the point that walking would be
painful. I think I&#39;ve fully recovered though so I should definitely get back to
running.

It was funny though, I had dreams of running in the morning. At least part of me
was wanting to do it. Dreams are interesting, aren&#39;t they? I remember clearly
in my dream getting out of bed and then running around the neighborhood.
Unfortunately it was easy to tell it was a dream because I didn&#39;t eat a quick
breakfast nor did I brush my teeth which I always do in the morning. The crazy
part was this dream happened 3 different times with 3 different scenarios, all
very realistic.

  <p>Frozen was such a nice movie! I love the animation style for it, very much
like Tangled! And the characters are so cute and this time, the music was very
catchy! I highly enjoyed the jokes and although the storyline wasn&#39;t my
favorite, it still has the charm to make it a classic in my books. Anyways,
I just wanted to share the multi-language version of &quot;Let It Go&quot; as I highly
enjoyed it:

Isn&#39;t that nice?! At first I actually didn&#39;t enjoy this song but it grew on me
especially considering how catchy it can be! Plus Idina Menzel performing the
original is absolutely amazing! I&#39;ve seen other covers but she definitely pulls
off the song so beautifully and her range is ridiculous as always! Let me know
what you think!

  <p>One of my friends proposed we jog in the mornings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I,
being of the sane mind, decided this would be a good start to the new year. Of
course the biggest barrier was that I never really jogged much as exercise in
the past. I&#39;ve gone on treadmills and done cardio exercises such as jumping
jacks and other various routines, but these were very small bursts throughout
my life. My treadmill days would be very infrequent and so starting a jogging
routine at 7:15 AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays seemed daunting, but I really
wanted to get in shape.

  <p>I&#39;m going to start blogging properly now! I really wanted to have a blog with
thoughts and ideas but things always fell short; however, this time I&#39;ve taken
the time to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and create my own template! I&#39;m excited to
start blogging again. I hope you join me in my adventures!
