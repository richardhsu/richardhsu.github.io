  <p>I use Kindle heavily for reference books and normal books across many devices
and for some reason, I always have issues with the Mac version of Kindle reader.
For some reason my purchased books do not always appear in my library. These are
the non-downloaded versions so I can&#39;t download them because I can&#39;t see them.

I&#39;ve found a fix that although can be annoying, works so far 100% of the
time. All you have to do is go to <code>Kindle &gt; Preferences</code> and then <strong>Deregister</strong>
your account and re-register! Now all your books should appear in your library
for you to download! I&#39;ve had to do this a couple of times which is annoying but
at least it works! Hope they fix this issue!

<strong>Edit (June 27, 2014):</strong> Apparently, this happens on the Windows version too.
You&#39;ll need to deregister as well and re-register to get all the books to appear
again. Quite disappointing.

  <p>I&#39;ve been rewatching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psych">Psych</a> on Netflix as my way to relieve stress from
the daily workday. It&#39;s been great and then yesterday I watched an episode that
really hit some interest bones. The episode contained:

<ol>
<li>Kenan Thompson who was hilarious in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_That">All That</a></li>
<li>Jaleel White who made the whole of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters">Family Matters</a></li>
<li>Acapella singing which I do enjoy and wish I could sing and be part of a
quartet or something.</li>
<li>Computer Security and Networking references which I&#39;ll discuss.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ninja">American Ninja</a> which hilariously, I didn&#39;t understand the name drop reference
because I never knew the actor&#39;s name so I assumed he was the director.</li>

  <p>Well today was a failure. I missed a running day. It might be good since my
ankle wasn&#39;t feeling well over the weekend to the point that walking would be
painful. I think I&#39;ve fully recovered though so I should definitely get back to
running.

It was funny though, I had dreams of running in the morning. At least part of me
was wanting to do it. Dreams are interesting, aren&#39;t they? I remember clearly
in my dream getting out of bed and then running around the neighborhood.
Unfortunately it was easy to tell that it was a dream because I didn&#39;t eat a
quick breakfast nor did I brush my teeth which I always do in the morning.
The crazy part was this dream happened 3 different times with 3 different
scenarios, all very realistic.

  <p>Frozen was such a nice movie! I love the animation style for it, very much
like Tangled! And the characters are so cute and this time, the music was very
catchy! I highly enjoyed the jokes and although the storyline wasn&#39;t my
favorite, it still has the charm to make it a classic in my books. Anyways,
I just wanted to share the multi-language version of &quot;Let It Go&quot; as I highly
enjoyed it:

Isn&#39;t that nice?! At first I actually didn&#39;t enjoy this song, but it grew on me
especially considering how catchy it can be! Plus Idina Menzel performing the
original is absolutely amazing! I&#39;ve seen other covers but she definitely pulls
off the song so beautifully and her range is ridiculous as always! Let me know
what you think!

  <p>One of my friends proposed that we jog in the mornings on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. I, being of the sane mind, decided this would be a good start to
the new year. Of course the biggest barrier was that I never really jogged
much in the past. I&#39;ve gone on treadmills and done cardio exercises such as
jumping jacks and other various routines, but these were very small bursts
throughout and probably would last no longer than 10 minutes. My treadmill
days would be very infrequent and so starting a jogging
routine at 7:15 AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays seemed extremely daunting.
But I really wanted to get in shape.
