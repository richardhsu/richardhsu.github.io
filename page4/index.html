  <p>Another day passes by and I forget to write. Or more than just forget, I do not
even think about writing. I really do want to actively write and have share
things but it seems difficult to always find a subject to talk about, find the
time to write, and get it done!

  <p>Ruby Version Manager (RVM) and OS X Mavericks can be painful. Though if you use
Ruby then you should use RVM so hopefully this guide can help. There&#39;s a lot of
issues with getting it to work. I am a course assistant for the Web Applications
course at Stanford University and we have students install RVM, Ruby, and Rails
and there have been so many issues that I thought I&#39;d make a post. I can&#39;t
guarantee that this will work but I&#39;ve tested it many times for OS X Mavericks
that I believe it should work!

  <p>Javascript is a funny language. I rarely find myself going &quot;oh that makes sense&quot;
, but then again when I think about all the rules and structures of the
language, it does make sense in that context ... Of course, I&#39;m not justifying
the language decisions, just that based on the design of the language, the
outcomes make sense.

  <p>Things have gotten a lot busier in school. Longer grading periods, more reading,
longer assignments, but I always make time for unwinding at least once a day. My
main source of unwinding is playing <a href="http://www.battlefield.com/">Battlefield 4</a>. If you play, this
weekend there&#39;s actually a Double XP Boost going on for Player Appreciation
Month, which by the way was only announced on Facebook and seems very odd that
no official announcement was made on the actual <a href="http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/">Battlelog</a> website.
Anyways, although it is a fun game it can be stressful but in a good way ...
until we get to the frustrations of it all.

The game can be very buggy at times and it can get quite annoying when I&#39;m just
trying to have fun. I&#39;m okay with the stresses generated by the gameplay of
attacking an objective with enemies ready to swarm in and kill. I&#39;m okay with
the stresses of being shocked around a corner by a shotgun. But playing a game
in which bugs introduce possible preceived unfairness is not okay. But then
again when I think about how massive this game is with at least one server
and near 64 or more participants, I am inspired by how such a game even
functions to begin with!

  <p>I use Kindle heavily for reference books and normal books across many devices
and for some reason, I always have issues with the Mac version of Kindle reader.
For some reason my purchased books do not always appear in my library. These are
the non-downloaded versions so I can&#39;t download them because I can&#39;t see them.

I&#39;ve found a fix that although can be annoying, works so far 100% of the
time. All you have to do is go to <code>Kindle &gt; Preferences</code> and then <strong>Deregister</strong>
your account and re-register! Now all your books should appear in your library
for you to download! I&#39;ve had to do this a couple of times which is annoying but
at least it works! Hope they fix this issue!

<strong>Edit (June 27, 2014):</strong> Apparently, this happens on the Windows version too.
You&#39;ll need to deregister as well and re-register to get all the books to appear
again. Quite disappointing.
